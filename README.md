# Change Pitch with Note Range &amp; 1st note Timing script

*Timing & Transposing script*

## What is it?
*Change Pitch with Note Range &amp; 1st note Timing* aka *CPRNT* is NI Kontakt simple script that can provide easy note **transposing** with your defined **note range** without compromising any keyswitches you have above or bellow that range. Also lots of legato patches have a bad timing of the first note according to next slured notes, for that case you can use **1st note Timing** feature to make your passage right. There is also two **Bypass** buttons for easy switch. Also there is easy switch button **Velocity to CC1** for short notes (stacc, tenuto, etc) which provides option to change dynamic of notes in that range from velocity (attack) to CC1. You can now very easily and fluidly draw dynamic for entire music passage without any hassle.
